PLEASE READ:

To add your own photos to the website:

1.  Copy your photo files into this folder (`public/memories`).
2.  Rename them to `mem1.jpg`, `mem2.jpg`, `mem3.jpg` (or whatever naming you prefer).
3.  Open `src/components/MemoryLane.jsx` in VS Code.
4.  Update the `img` field in the `memories` list to match your filenames.
    Example: `img: "/memories/my-photo.jpg"`

That's it!
